# System calls

(Almost) any time your program wants to do I/O on Linux, this happens via _system calls_.

These are "function calls" that happen across the userspace-kernel boundary.

They have a C API, but because they cross this boundary, they are not simply C function calls.
Instead, they use architecture-dependent calling conventions, explicitly using certain hardware features (such as named registers).

C standard libraries expose C-based wrappers around this.

There are hundreds system calls; some examples:

```c
man 2 read    ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
man 2 write   ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```

## System calls example in assembly


```asm
; Example from https://jameshfisher.com/2018/03/10/linux-assembly-hello-world/
global _start
section .text

_start:
  mov rax, 1        ; write(
  mov rdi, 1        ;   STDOUT_FILENO,
  mov rsi, msg      ;   "Hello, world!\n",
  mov rdx, msglen   ;   sizeof("Hello, world!\n")
  syscall           ; );

  mov rax, 60       ; exit(
  mov rdi, 0        ;   EXIT_SUCCESS
  syscall           ; );

section .rodata
  msg: db "Hello, world!", 10
  msglen: equ $ - msg
```

```bash
$ nasm -f elf64 -o hello.o hello.s
$ ld -o hello hello.o
$ ./hello
Hello, world!
```

---

## strace demo

```bash
$ strace -f example-programs-build/hello-linux-x86_64
```

```c
execve("example-programs-build/hello-linux-x86_64", ["example-programs-build/hello-lin"...], [/* 84 vars */]) = 0
write(1, "Hello, world!\n", 14Hello, world!
)         = 14
exit(0)                                 = ?
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

Notice interleaved output (stderr of the program, and stderr of `strace`).

You can clean it up with e.g.

```bash
strace -f example-programs-build/hello-linux-x86_64 > /dev/null
```

## System calls bring transparency

System calls are a **well-defined boundary**.
All programs need to use them, **even closed-source** ones.

**You can figure out most of what a program does by just inspecting the syscalls.**

Syscall-based investigations work on

<center><em>any program in any programming language</em></center>

This is why I use `strace` every day.

It immediately reveils:

* bugs in what the program should do
* performance problems, like
  * reading the same file over and over again
  * unecessary network roundtrips

---

# The need for scriptable syscall tracing

`strace` is great for inspecting a program's syscalls.

You can run it, do some manual filtering e.g. using **`grep`**, and then draw your conclusions.

But you cannot automate it well.

Often you need:

* a reproducible yes/no answer on whether something happens
* do interaction with the traced program at specific points
* an API to do the above

---

# `hatrace`

Code: https://github.com/nh2/hatrace

### `hatrace` executable

* intended to do most of what `strace` does, with lots of extra features
* coloured output *
* JSON output *
* less portability than `strace` because Haskell runs on fewer architectures

### `hatrace` Haskell library

* full control over everything
* makes writing custom tools and repros easy

(* in the making)

---

# `hatrace` - Use cases

### **General**

  * Get all syscalls in a list and process them programatically.
  * Audit high-assurance software systems.
  * Debug difficult bugs that occur only in certain rare situations.
  * Change the results of system calls as seen by the traced program.

### **Bug reproducers**

  * Demonstrate how a program fails when a given syscall returns certain data.
  * Kill your build tool at the 3rd `write()` syscall to an `.o` file, checking whether it will recover from that in the next run.

---

### **Testing**

  * Write test suites that assert how your code uses system calls, for correctness or performance.
  * Mock syscalls to test how your program would behave in situations that are difficult to create in the real world.
  * Implement anomaly test suites [like `sqlite` does](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html#i_o_error_testing), exhaustively testing whether your program can recover from a crash in _any_ syscall.

### **Fuzzing**

  * Insert garbage data into the program by changing syscall results or directly changing its memory contents.
  * Speed up your fuzzing by having full insight into the fuzzed program's behaviour.

### **Adding features to existing programs**

  * Add "magic" support for new file systems without modifying existing programs (like [this paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/expcs07/papers/22-spillane.pdf) shows).
  * Add logging capabilities to programs that were designed without.

## test suite tour

Shows many example use cases and how they are written.

### Example: Getting all syscalls in a list

```haskell
it "allows obtaining all syscalls as a list for hello.asm" $ do

  -- Resolve full path to executable
  argv <- procToArgv "example-programs-build/hello-linux-x86_64" []

  (exitCode, events) <- sourceTraceForkExecvFullPathWithSink argv CL.consume

  let syscalls =
        [ sc | (_pid, SyscallStop (SyscallEnter (sc, _args))) <- events ]

  exitCode `shouldBe` ExitSuccess
  syscalls `shouldBe`
    [ KnownSyscall Syscall_execve
    , KnownSyscall Syscall_write
    , KnownSyscall Syscall_exit
    ]
```

`hatrace` offers a streaming interface (via the `conduit` library), so that you can interact with the program while receiving syscall events.

In this call, we don't interact and just turn the stream into a list with `CL.consume`.

---

# Built on `ptrace()`

`ptrace()` is what `strace` and `gdb` are implemented on top of.

It stops the traced program every time some IO happens.

Let's you do things when the program is stopped.

Stop types:

* `PTRACE_EVENT` stops
* Syscall-stops
* Signal-delivery-stop
* Death

You can read and write memory and registers.

That way you can inspect and modify system calls and their results.

When you're done, you tell the tracee to continue running until the next stop.

## custom tools

Custom tools are easy to add and usually require only a few lines of Haskell.

---

## Custom tools examples

### `execve()` tree

Shows programs and their children _live_ as they are created, in a tree format.

Also collects them into a final tree in the end.

```
./hatrace-exec-tree -- bash -c 'true && /usr/bin/time bash -c "true && /bin/echo hi"'
```

### Finding non-atomic writes

Find all `write()`s to files that weren't followed by a `rename()`.

```
stack exec -- hatrace \
  --find-nonatomic-writes example-programs-build/atomic-write non-atomic 10 tempfile
```

```
The following files were written nonatomically by the program:
 - "/home/niklas/src/haskell/hatrace/tempfile"
```

---

# What needs doing

I've only started working on `hatrace` very recently.

It already found and reliably reproduced a hard-to-reproduce bug in the GHC Haskell Compiler.

But it still needs help from you:

* Adding more syscall details
* reading tracee memory more efficiently
* hatrace executable features
  * JSON output
  * coloured output
  * special run modes tailored to specific tasks (e.g. `execve` tree)
* Equivalent to `strace -y` (tracking origin of file descriptors, printing paths)
* Equivalent to `strace -c` (keeping counts, summary statistics)
* OSX support? WSL support? ([#1](https://github.com/nh2/hatrace/issues/1))
* More on https://github.com/nh2/hatrace#todo-list-for-contributors

# A bit of syscall philosophy

### Syscall-oriented programming

> Trying to make your program emit do exactly the right syscalls is one path to sanity.
